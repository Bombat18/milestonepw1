## Introduction

The Bike Landing Page Website is a single-page website that showcases various bikes, biking accessories, and promotes the biking lifestyle. It is built with HTML for the structure and Tailwind CSS for the styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with its set of pre-defined classes.

The website includes the following features:


1. **Attractive Hero Section:** The homepage features a captivating hero section with a large background image, catchy tagline, and a prominent call-to-action button.

2. **Product Showcase:** The website showcases different bikes and biking accessories in a visually appealing grid layout. Each item is accompanied by a brief description and price.

3. **Contact Form:** To encourage potential customers to get in touch, a contact form is included, allowing users to send inquiries or messages directly to the bike shop.

4. **Social Media Integration:** Links to the bike shop's social media profiles are provided, allowing users to connect and follow updates on various platforms.
