## Introduction

The NFT Lending Page Website is a platform that allows users to lend their Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to others in exchange for rewards or interest. It aims to facilitate the borrowing and lending of NFT assets within the crypto community. The website provides an intuitive user interface to interact with the lending smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to connect and interact with their Web3 wallet.
- Browse available NFT lending options.
- View details of NFTs available for lending.
- Choose lending periods and interest rates.
- Initiate lending transactions using the connected Web3 wallet.
- Track lending history and rewards earned.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bombat18/milestonepw1/tree/main/Project 4_ NFT Landing page
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Project 4_ NFT Landing page
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Upon opening the website, users will be prompted to connect their Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask). After connecting, users can browse through available NFT lending options, view lending details, and choose lending periods and interest rates. Users can then initiate lending transactions by following the on-screen instructions.

Please note that this is a front-end implementation, and it requires a compatible Web3 wallet extension (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
